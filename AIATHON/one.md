## Completely Virtual AI-A-THON <br> February 26 - March 12, 2021

The SDSU AI Club will be hosting its **first ever** small scale virtual coding competition. This compeition can be seen as similar to a mini hackathon. The competition involves an individual or a group tackling an artificial intellegence related problem by creating a tool or application. As mentioned the theme of the competition will be related to AI however, the actual guidelines won't be revealed until the day of the competition.

The AI-A-THON is open to current club members as well as SDSU students for ```FREE```. We encourage anyone, regardless of background to join and attempt to grow as an engineer. Our club will be providing guidance and mentorship throughout the event so no group or individual feels left behind. This is an opportunity that brings collaboration, empowerment, and innovation in a span of 2 weeks.
