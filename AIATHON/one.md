The SDSU AI Club will be hosting its **first ever** small scale virtual coding competition. This compeition can be seen as similar to a mini hackathon. The competition involves an individual or a group tackling an artificial intellegence related problem by creating a tool or application. As mentioned the theme of the competition will be related to AI however, the actual guidelines won't be revealed until the day of the competition.

We encourage anyone, regardless of background to join and attempt to grow as a developer. Our club will be providing guidance and mentorship throughout the event so no group or individual
