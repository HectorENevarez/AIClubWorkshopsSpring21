## Completely Virtual AI-A-THON <br> February 19 - March 2, 2021


The SDSU AI Club will be hosting its **first ever** small scale virtual coding competition. This compeition can be seen as similar to a mini hackathon. The competition involves an individual or a group tackling an artificial intellegence related problem by creating a tool or application. As mentioned the theme of the competition will be related to AI however, the actual guidelines won't be revealed until the day of the competition.

The AI-A-THON is open to current club members as well as SDSU students. We encourage anyone, regardless of background to join and attempt to grow as a developer. Our club will be providing guidance and mentorship throughout the event so no group or individual feels left behind. This is an opportunity that brings collaboration, empowerment, and innovation in a span of 2 weeks.

## Sturcture
Going into the competition it's important to understand the process of the event. In the following section, the structure and timeline of the event will be broken down.

### Registration
To enter the competition, one must first be registered. The registration portion involves registering how many members will be in a specified group. a group can have up to a maximum of 4 people. One may also work alone or opt to be assigned to a random group. In order to be eligible, the registration must be done 16 hours before the competition starts.

### Day 1
The first day of the competition will be on February 19 at 10:00 AM during our usual club meeting time. During this time all groups will be finalized and the guidelines of the competition will announced. From there groups will be seperated into break out rooms where they will brainstorm ideas for their project with their team. If any groups or members can't make it to the meeting, all information as well as competition guidelines will be sent to each member.

### Creation and Submission
The competition will last just short of two weeks. This timeframe gives teams enough time to brainstorm a concept and potentially a working system. All SDSU AI Club executive team members will be able to assist groups with any questions they may have technical or not. On March 1 at 8:00 PM all submissions must be provided based on the given submission guidelines.
