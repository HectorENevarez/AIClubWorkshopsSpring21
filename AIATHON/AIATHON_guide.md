## Welcome
For the past couple years, our club has presented workshops on various artificial intelligence related topics. We wanted to switch the roles and have you get your feet wet by brainstorming and possibly creating a small project idea. The main goal is to let you have the creative freedom to create a small tool.

## Prompt
Design a tool that integrates any type of artificial intelligence that would make your life easier. Think of an issue or process you deal with constantly that could be improved with artificial intelligence. This could range anywhere from a tool that uses computer vision to track a pet to a machine learning algorithm that auto-generates tweets for you to post. There is no idea that is too simple or complex but you must benefit from this tool.

## Timeline
2/26 10:00AM - Competition begins and prompt is released<br>
3/11 8:00PM - Complete submission is due<br>
3/12 10:00AM - participants will present tool and winners will be announced<br>

## Guidance
Throughout this entire process all 5 executive team members will be available for guidance. Any member can be messaged through slack or discord. The 5 executive team members are:
- Antoine Tamagno
- Andrew Barret
- Brittany Hughes
- Matt Turi
- Hector Nevarez

## Submission
The submission should clearly explain your tool and its purpose. There is no expectation to have a completely working tool however one can earn bonus points with a working demo. In your presentation really focus on the structure of your tool. The submission can be a powerpoint, README, or anything else you have complete creative freedom as to how you submit. Also keep in mind your submission would be what you present. Here would be an example of a submission:

- [Covid Risk Mitigator](https://github.com/HectorENevarez/Covid-Risk-Detection)

## Prize
1st place - 30$ AWS credit<br>
2nd place - 20$ AWS credit<br>
3rd place - 10$ AWS credit

## Judging
Judging will be done in real time based on the following categories ranging from 1 to 5:
1. Innovation: How creative is the idea
2. Practicality: How useful is the tool
3. Presentation Quality: How well the tool is presented

Bonus points will also be awarded for the following optional category:
1. Live Demo: How well the product works in real time
